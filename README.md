# SplitBetter

## What is it?

SplitBetter is an attempt at making the process of splitting group transactions better. Think 17 person dinners, weekend trips to foreign cities, back and forth "taking the check" with your best bud. We'll track who owe who and tell you the best way to settle up.

## What's next?

SplitBetter is in current development with a full backlog and will be hitting iOS and Android app stores in the coming months.

## How can I help?

Subbmit a PR or reach out if you're interested in what ideas we have.
